    "# Link Prediction in Social Network Analysis (SNA)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore **Link Prediction** in Social Network Analysis using machine learning techniques. Social networks are composed of individuals (nodes) connected by relationships (edges), and link prediction aims to predict future or missing connections based on the current structure of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **Zachary's Karate Club** dataset (a classic social network graph), we will:\n",
    "- Visualize the original social network,\n",
    "- Extract features from the network (such as common neighbors),\n",
    "- Train a machine learning model to predict missing links,\n",
    "- Evaluate the model's accuracy, and\n",
    "- Visualize the predicted links in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will demonstrate how to implement basic link prediction using the **Random Forest** classifier from `scikit-learn`, along with the **NetworkX** library for network visualization and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand how link prediction can be applied in social networks and how machine learning helps uncover hidden or future relationships between individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps:\n",
    "1. **Graph Creation and Visualization**: We'll start by visualizing the network structure of Zachary's Karate Club.\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation**: We'll split the network into existing links (edges) and missing links (non-edges), which will serve as the dataset for training our model.\n",
    "3. **Feature Extraction**: We'll calculate features like common neighbors between pairs of nodes to help the model predict new links.\n",
    "4. **Model Training**: A Random Forest classifier will be trained on the existing data to learn the patterns of link formation.\n",
    "5. **Prediction and Evaluation**: We'll test the model on unseen data to predict which non-existent links are likely to form, and evaluate its performance.\n",
    "6. **Visualization of Predictions**: Finally, we'll visualize the predicted links as red dashed lines in the graph to show potential new connections.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this step, we will create and visualize the social network using the **NetworkX** library.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graph: Zachary's Karate Club\n",
    "We are using **Zachary's Karate Club Graph**, a well-known social network dataset in network analysis. This graph represents friendships between 34 members of a karate club, where nodes represent individuals, and edges represent friendships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Tasks:\n",
    "1. **Loading the Graph**: We use the `nx.karate_club_graph()` function from NetworkX to load this pre-built graph dataset. It's a great example for link prediction tasks due to its small size and real-world structure.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Positioning Nodes**: To visualize the graph, we need to compute positions for each node. We use the `spring_layout()` function, which positions the nodes based on a force-directed algorithm, creating an intuitive and easy-to-understand graph layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Graph Visualization**: We will visualize the network using `Matplotlib`. The graph will display:\n",
    "   - **Nodes**: Each node represents an individual in the club.\n",
    "   - **Edges**: Edges between nodes represent existing friendships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing the graph gives us a clear picture of the network structure, allowing us to understand the relationships between individuals before we proceed to predict new or missing links.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Visualization is Important:\n",
    "By visualizing the graph, we can observe the structure of relationships within the network and detect any patterns or clusters. This step helps in understanding the data before moving to machine learning tasks.\n",

    "1. **Common Neighbors**: One of the simplest yet effective features for link prediction is the number of **common neighbors** between two nodes. The more common friends two individuals have, the more likely they are to form a connection. We will define a function, `common_neighbors(u, v, G)`, that counts the common neighbors between nodes `u` and `v` in graph `G`.\n",
